# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is [Udemy Courses](https://gist.github.com/daojunL/a16adf2fd9009a06b8692224265c72e6)

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart and it shows the top 10 most subscribed courses and the number of subscribers.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which is the most popular subject on Udemy Website?
 * Is the number of subscribers and the number of reviews correlated?
 * What are the top 10 most popular courses?

## Sketches

The sketch calculates how many courses each subject has. So, from the bar chart, we can conclude which subject is the most popular on the Udemy website.

This sketch is a scatter plot of the number of reviews and the number of subscribers. We can roughly see if the two variables are correlated from the scatter plot. 

## Open Questions

- For drawing the scatter plot, maybe there is a need to removing the outliers. For this part, I don't exactly know how to remove the outliers.
